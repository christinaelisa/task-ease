# Welcome to TASK BUNNY 

### OVERVIEW

Task bunny is a full stack web application that allows users to create, edit, delete, and cross out task items on a todo list. This app was created using React JS, React hooks (useState and useEffect), CSS, HTML, Material and Semantic UI libraries for the front end and a local JSON server to create a mock back end.
